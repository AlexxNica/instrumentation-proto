Census Proto - Language Independent Interface Types For Census
===============================================================
Census provides a framework to define and collect stats against metrics and to
break those stats down across user-defined dimensions.

The Census framework is natively available in many languages (e.g. C++, Go,
and Java). The API interface types are defined using protos to ensure
consistency and interoperability for the different implementations.
